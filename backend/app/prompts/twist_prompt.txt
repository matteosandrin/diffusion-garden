Take the following idea and generate 5 different twists, each in a clearly different direction:

One mundane / everyday twist (make it surprisingly ordinary rather than epic).
One historical or period twist (set in the past, not the future).
One comedic twist.
One dark or psychological twist.
One magical realism or surreal twist.

For each twist give a 2–3 sentence description of the idea.

Avoid sci-fi or futuristic elements in all twists unless the original idea is explicitly science fiction.
